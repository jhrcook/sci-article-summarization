Here we show\u00a0that Myc activation induces rapid transcriptional responses followed by proliferation in some, but not all, organs. Despite such disparities in proliferative response, Myc is bound to DNA at open elements in responsive (liver) and non-responsive (heart) tissues, but fails to induce a robust transcriptional and proliferative response in the heart. Using heart as an exemplar of a non-responsive tissue, we show that Myc-driven transcription is re-engaged in mature cardiomyocytes by elevating levels of the\u00a0positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb), instating a large proliferative response. Hence, P-TEFb activity is a key limiting determinant of whether the heart is permissive for Myc transcriptional activation. These data provide a greater understanding of how Myc transcriptional activity is determined and indicate modification of P-TEFb levels could be utilised to drive regeneration of adult cardiomyocytes for the treatment of heart myopathies."], "Introduction": ["Myc is a basic helix-loop-helix\u2013leucine zipper (bHLH\u2013LZ) transcription factor that binds preferentially to specific sequences in the genome, termed E-boxes, via association with its bHLH\u2013LZ heterodimerisation partner Max. Myc functions principally as a transcriptional activator by potentiating transcription initiation via association with various cofactors, such as TRRAP and associated histone acetyl-transferases and facilitating productive transcriptional elongation by promoting RNA polymerase II (PolII) loading and via its association with the positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is comprised of CDK9 and Cyclin T1 that are stringently regulated by various transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, and dynamically controlled by an association with an inactivation complex comprised of 7SK snRNA, Larp7, MEPCE and HEXIM. P-TEFb phosphorylates DSIF, NELF and serine 2 of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of paused RNA PolII leading to productive elongation.", "Myc is a highly pleiotropic proto oncogene that coordinates multiple transcriptional programmes underpinning normal cell replication, differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis. Together with the dedicated role in controlling the growth and division of normal cells, Myc also governs diverse cell extrinsic processes required for tissue regeneration in a manner that is tightly tailored to the tissue, in which Myc is activated. Since deregulated and elevated Myc expression is a pervasive and causal attribute of most, perhaps all, tumours, understanding how tissue-specific responses to Myc are determined at a molecular level is imperative.", "Comprehensive analysis of Myc transcriptional output in individual cell types indicates that Myc regulates the expression of thousands of genes, perhaps a third of the transcriptome. Such studies show great diversity across experimental platforms and hint that components of the transcriptional repertoire of Myc are highly context specific. In particular, genome-wide analysis of Myc occupancy indicates the presence of Myc on virtually all promoters with open chromatin, suggesting that tissue-specific variations in Myc activity arise by engagement of specific, pre-configured resident cellular transcriptional programmes. However, this large and diverse repertoire of potential Myc target genes, and the lack of comparative analysis of transcriptional responses to Myc in different tissues, have together confounded reliable identification of common and tissue-specific Myc-dependent transcriptional programmes. Moreover, recruitment of Myc to a given gene does not always correlate with its level of transcription, and binding efficiency and transcriptional outputs are influenced significantly by different levels of Myc expression. Consequently, both the precise mechanism as to how Myc targets genes and what factors govern the transcriptional consequence of Myc binding in differing tissue types remains unclear.", "We show that Myc transcription is dependent on the level of P-TEFb within a cell. Overexpression of both Myc and Cyclin T1 in the normally non-responsive heart facilitates Myc-driven transcription and proliferation."], "Methods": {"Mice and mouse maintenance": ["All experimental procedures received ethical approval and were conducted in accordance with the Home Office UK guidelines, under project licences 70/7586, 80/2396 (G.I.E.), which were evaluated and approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body at the University of Cambridge.

In this knock-in mouse strain, the R26LSL-c-MycER locus (R26MER) is modified to include a CAG (chicken beta actin/CMV) enhancer that augments MycERT2 expression (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). R26CAG-LSL-c-MycERT2 mice were crossed into the Tg(Zp3-cre)93Knw strain, in which Cre is active in the oocyte, efficiently excising the LSL stop cassette in all adult tissues of the resultant R26CMER mice. Compared with the physiological level of Myc expressed in R26MER/+ cells (heterozygous for the R26MER allele), R26CMER/+ cells express around eightfold higher levels of MycERT2 RNA (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b) in each tissue tested. R26CAG-LSL-MER and R26LSL-MER mice were interbred to generate an allelic series of ascending levels of MycERT2 expression (R26+/+, R26LSL-MER/+, R26LSL-MER/LSL-MER, R26CAG-LSL-MER/+, R26CAG-LSL-MER/LSL-MER and R26CAG-LSL-MER/CAG-LSL-MER). To measure directly relative levels of MycERT2 in this allelic series, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from each strain and the LSL stop cassette excised by infection in vitro with a Cre-expressing adenovirus to engage constitutive MycERT2 expression. Western blot analysis of cell lysates confirmed an ascending allelic series of MycERT2 expression, with homozygous R26MER and R26CMER cells expressing twice the level of their respective heterozygous counterparts (Fig.\u00a01a). This allelic expression series was precisely mirrored in tissues from heterozygous and homozygous R26CMER mice (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c).", "To rule out the possibility that high levels of Myc might modulate the Rosa26 promoter\u2014and hence elicit artefactual feedback effects\u2014we crossed R26CMER mice to mice carrying a R26mTmG (Gt(ROSA)26Sortm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo) reporter allele. Systemic activation of MycERT2 in R26CMER/mTmG mice had no impact on expression of either Tomato or MycERT2 transcripts in any tested tissues (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d). Hence, elevated\u00a0MycERT2 activity does not modulate activity of the Rosa26 promoter.", "We next determined whether acute activation of MycERT2 elicits a proliferative response in tissues of R26CMER/+ mice. MycERT2 was activated for 24\u2009h by systemic administration of tamoxifen and proliferation assessed by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67, bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 (p-H3). We observed a consistent pattern of proliferative responses to supraphysiological Myc in tissues (Fig.\u00a01b, c) that fell into three general classes: (1) adult tissues, such as liver, lung and pancreas with normally low levels of endogenous Myc (Fig.\u00a01d), but capable of significant regeneration after injury. Such tissues showed a marked induction of proliferation upon Myc activation. (2) Adult tissues, such as kidney, heart and brain, with normally low levels of endogenous Myc and a limited capacity to regenerate. In these, Myc elicited only a negligible rise in proliferation. (3) Tissues with constitutively high proliferative rates and substantial constitutive levels of endogenous Myc (Fig.\u00a01d), such as thymus and spleen, in which activation of ectopic Myc elicited no significant additional proliferation above the already high basal level. Neither sustaining MycERT2 activation for 3 days nor increasing the expression level of MycERT2 from one to two copies of R26CMER changed the proliferative responses to Myc in any tissue (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e\u2013h). Hence, different tissues harbour different inherent sensitivities to Myc-driven proliferation."], "Myc binding does not correlate with efficient transcription": ["There are several plausible explanations for the failure of acute Myc activation to induce a proliferative response in tissues, such as heart and brain. First, non-responsive tissues might express high levels of one or more of the Mxd proteins, which could directly antagonise Myc\u2019s transcriptional function by sequestering Max and/or competing for its binding to shared target genes. To investigate this possibility, we determined the levels of Mxd expression in various tissues. Although expression of Mxd family members varied across tissues (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a), we saw no correlation between the extent of Myc-induced proliferation and the levels of Mxd transcripts. Next, we determined whether Myc is still able to bind its target genes using ChIP-sequencing analysis of Myc binding sites 4\u2009h after activation in exemplar responsive (liver) and non-responsive (heart) tissue. We observed a dramatic increase in gene occupancy upon MycERT2 activation in both tissues, from a few hundred sites in wild-type control, reflecting the low levels of endogenous Myc expression in these tissues, to ~30,000 after Myc activation (Fig.\u00a02a). Hence, the failure of the heart to proliferate in response to Myc activation cannot be attributed to the inability of ectopic Myc to access its target genes. Around a quarter of Myc target binding sites were common to both tissues, with a significant overlap principally at promoter elements (Fig.\u00a02b, c). Motif analysis demonstrated significant enrichment for the E-box consensus sequences at these regions (Fig.\u00a02d) and gene ontology indicated that these overlapping promoter binding sites located to \u2018classic\u2019 core Myc-dependent genes implicated in control of gene expression, mRNA processing and mitotic cell cycle (Fig.\u00a02d). In addition to these shared targets, however, Myc also bound discrete sets of promoter elements that differed between the two tissues (Fig.\u00a02b). These tissue-specific sites were also enriched for E-box consensus sequences but demonstrated a generally lower affinity for Myc in comparison to the shared core elements (Fig.\u00a02e, f). Interestingly, these tissue-specific promoter elements were associated with genes whose expression defines each tissue (i.e., hepatocytes vs cardiomyocytes respectively\u2014Fig.\u00a02e, f), consistent with the idea that Myc binds already active/open promoters. Myc ChIP-seq profiles, RNA PolII ChIP-seq in normal liver and heart, ATAC-seq in purified cardiomyocytes, publicly available data for chromatin marks of active transcription (H3K27 acetylation H3K4 tri-methylation and H3K4 mono-methylation) and DNAse-seq in heart and liver all concurred that Myc binding closely overlaps with transcriptionally active promoter and distal elements in each tissue. This holds true across both common and tissue-specific Myc-bound sites. For example, promoters bound in the heart but not liver are characterised by absence of active chromatin marks and RNA PolII binding in the liver. Conversely, promoters bound by Myc only in liver lack active chromatin marks or associated RNA PolII in heart (Fig.\u00a03a, b, Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a, b). To confirm Myc binding to genes implicated in the transcriptional control of cell cycle in the heart, liver and purified cardiomyocytes, we performed sub analysis of Myc binding and open chromatin marks in a mitotic cell cycle gene set (GO: 0000278). Over 60% of these sites were marked as open and Myc bound (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03c, d). These data confirm that Myc binds \u201copen\u201d chromatin at both promoters and distal sites (enhancers), and that the disposition of chromatin accessibility to Myc is pre-configured in a tissue-specific way. Together, these data indicate that adult terminally differentiated heart retains an open chromatin architecture at sites required for Myc to drive transcriptional control of proliferation and that the regenerative capacity of the heart is lost due to the transcriptional control rather than an epigenetic block.", "Since Myc efficiently binds target gene DNA in both heart and liver, we investigated other potential mechanism(s) that might limit proliferative output in the non-responsive heart. We first determined the overall transcriptional output in various tissues (heart, kidney, liver and lung) of R26CMER/+ and R26+/+ control mice, following acute Myc activation for 4\u2009h. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were called in each tissue based on the fold change (FC) in mRNA levels between R26CMER/+ and R26+/+ control mice (Log2FC\u2009\u2265\u20090.5, q\u2009\u2264\u20090.05). In agreement with previous observations, the total number of DEGs in each tissue (Fig.\u00a04a, Supplementary Data\u00a01) was much lower than the number of Myc-bound promoters, albeit with significant inclusive overlap (Fig.\u00a04b). Comparison of DEGs in the liver, lung, kidney and heart indicated considerable commonality among up-regulated genes (Fig.\u00a04c) implicated in prototypical core Myc-regulated processes, such as ncRNA, rRNA and tRNA, metabolic processes (Fig.\u00a04d). By contrast, Myc-repressed genes showed very little overlap across tissues, although gene ontology analysis did suggest that genes overlapping in two or more organs favoured involvement in negative regulation of cell movement, locomotion and migration (Fig.\u00a04e, f). Tissue-specific genes down-regulated by Myc showed significant overlap with genes normally expressed within that tissue, (Fig.\u00a04g, Supplementary Data\u00a02) and their functions were generally associated with differentiated tissue-specific processes (Fig.\u00a04h, Supplementary Data\u00a02).", "Remarkably, DEG numbers also correlated well with each tissue\u2019s proliferative response to MycERT2 (Figs.\u00a04a and\u00a01b, c): tissues with the lowest overall transcriptional changes displayed the least proliferative responses. However, while activation of ectopic Myc induced significant transcriptional changes in a greater number of target genes in liver than in heart, quantitative analysis of the RNA showed that most of the mRNAs that were induced in liver also exhibited modest, if non-significant, responses in the heart (Fig.\u00a04i). Indeed, gene-set enrichment analysis in the heart confirmed a significant trend in the increased expression of common Myc targets, even when defined as targets commonly up-regulated in response to Myc in all tissues, excluding the heart (Fig.\u00a04j). Hence, the transcriptional response to activation of ectopic Myc in the heart is not absent but highly attenuated and below that required to initiate cell proliferation. This refractoriness of the heart transcriptome to Myc remained evident even after prolonged (24\u2009h) Myc activation or in response to very high Myc levels (homozygous R26CMER mice; Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a, b)."], "Myc transcriptional output is limited by P-TEFb": ["The most plausible explanation for our data is that the attenuated transcriptional and biological response to Myc in heart is due to either active transcriptional inhibition and/or insufficiency of requisite transcriptional cofactors or machinery. Consistent with this, both the total and phosphorylated levels of the CTD of RNA PolII (Rpb1) were much lower in non-responsive heart and kidney than in Myc-responsive tissues, such as the liver and lung (Fig.\u00a05a). Since recruitment of P-TEFb is necessary for transcriptional elongation, we next assessed the expression levels of the components of P-TEFb\u2013CDK9 and Cyclin T1. Surprisingly, both CDK9 and Cyclin T1 proteins were present at considerably lower levels in the heart and kidney compared with lung or liver, along with components of the pause factors NELF and DSIF (Fig.\u00a05a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a). Conversely, both Larp7, a negative regulator of P-TEFb, and the 7SK short non-coding RNA that serves as the scaffold for the P-TEFb inactivation complex were relatively more abundant in the heart and kidney (Fig.\u00a05a, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b). This intimated that the inability of Myc to elicit transcriptional changes in the heart arises from a tissue-specific deficiency in core transcriptional cofactors, notably P-TEFb and RNA PolII itself, that are required for efficient transcriptional initiation and elongation. Since paused RNA PolII is dependent upon P-TEFb for progression, we directly tested whether transcriptional elongation is generally rate limiting for Myc-driven transcription using the specific CDK9 inhibitor AZ5576 (AstraZeneca) to inhibit P-TEFb in liver. Wild-type and R26CMER/+ mice were concurrently treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; to activate MycERT2) and AZ5576, and livers collected 4\u2009h later. AZ5576 effectively inhibited CDK9 activity, as attested by a decrease in phosphorylated Rpb1 levels (Fig.\u00a05b) and, notwithstanding the presence of active MycERT2, such inhibition of CDK9 significantly attenuated transcription of Smpdl3b, Cad, Gnl3 and Polr3g, genes regulated by Myc in multiple tissues (Fig.\u00a05c). Hence, inhibition of P-TEFb, and consequential decreased phosphorylation of RNA PolII, renders liver non-permissive for Myc response. The same was observed in MEFs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c, e). Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Cyclin T1 in adult R26CMER/+ cardiomyocytes in vitro efficiently abrogated their normal refractoriness to Myc and permitted efficient expression of Myc target genes previously shown to be Myc unresponsive in adult heart (Bzw2, Pinx1, Polr3d, St6 and Cdc25a; Fig.\u00a05d, e, Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f, g). Together, these data support the notion that transcriptional activity of Myc is limited by P-TEFb availability. Further experiments would be required to determine the mechanistic basis of this dependency."]}, "Discussion": ["Myc is widely acknowledged to play a pivotal coordinating role in the transcriptional control of somatic cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, and its activity is deregulated and typically elevated in the majority of aggressive cancers. Past studies have largely focused on identifying Myc transcriptional programmes that are common across cell types. However, Myc exhibits great cell type variability, both with respect to how efficiently it can drive cell proliferation and the phenotypes its activities elicit in different tissues. We developed a unique mouse model whereby a switchable variant of Myc is driven at a comparable and defined oncogenic level from an augmented version of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter in target cells. The variant, augmented Rosa26 promoter incorporates an additional CAG (CMV and \u03b2-actin promoter elements) that increases the expression level of Myc to supraphysiological levels frequent in many cancers. Unlike most tissue-specific promoters used to drive transgenic oncogenes, neither Rosa26 nor RosaCAG promoters are repressed by Myc activation, obviating a major confounding artefact in most conventional transgenic models. Replacing Myc with the well validated, rapid and reversible switchable 4-OHT-dependent MycERT2 variant allows the analysis of the immediate and direct impact of Myc on its target genome. Inclusion of tissue-specific regulation via a Cre recombinase-excisable transcriptional STOP element provides the option for tissue restricted MycERT2 expression.", "Using proliferation as the phenotypic signature of Myc output, we identified three general classes of response to activation of oncogenic levels of Myc: tissues that proliferated in response to MycERT2 activation; tissues that did not; and tissues that exhibited innately high endogenous Myc and proliferative indices. The correlation between proliferative response to ectopic Myc in these tissues (Fig.\u00a01b, c) and the innate regenerative potential of each tissue is striking and suggests an underlying mechanistic connection.", "ChIP-seq analysis 4\u2009h post MycERT2 activation in exemplar Myc-responsive vs non-responsive tissues (respectively, liver and heart) showed a dramatic increase in gene occupancy by Myc in both tissues. Hence, tissue non-responsiveness to Myc is not due to failure of ectopic Myc to access its chromatin targets. On the contrary, we found striking similarities between the numbers of sites to which Myc is bound across the different tissues analysed, underscoring that the phenotypic outcome effected by Myc is not solely dictated at the level of recruitment to chromatin. The significant overlap in Myc-bound promoter regions across both the liver and heart affirms the widely held notion that Myc binds a discrete set of target genes common to multiple cell types and implicated in governing core processes required for cell growth and cell cycle progression. Nonetheless, Myc also binds a set of promoter elements specific to each tissue, indicating that the overall Myc-dependent cistrome is cell type specific. We also note that this tissue-specific Myc binding repertoire is characterised by the presence of chromatin marks indicative of open chromatin, in keeping with the findings of others.", "Interestingly, as early as 4-h post Myc activation, we clearly see a significant number of genes to be transcriptionally repressed. These repressed genes principally articulate differentiated cell type functions and show very little overlap between tissue types. Moreover, around a third (34%) of the repressed genes appear to be indirect targets, since Myc is not detected at their promoters (Fig.\u00a04b). Suppression of differentiation-specific genes by oncogenic Myc has been widely observed irrespective of cell or tissue type and is an example of the robust inverse generic relationship between cell proliferation and differentiation.", "It has been proposed that stringent normalisation strategies employed in the analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data can mask the more global impact of Myc on transcription that might be predicted from its promiscuous binding to open chromatin. Such general amplification is in no way excluded by our analyses. Nonetheless, it is clear that the magnitude of transcriptional change that the activation of ectopic Myc can instruct is significantly limited in tissues that lack regenerative potential, like the heart.", "A simple hypothetical explanation for the pervasive suppression of differentiation by Myc is that certain essential components of the transcriptional machinery, such as P-TEFb or even total levels of Rbp1, available for loading onto promoters are limiting and that repression of differentiation-specific genes is a mere consequence of these limiting factors\u2019 being redeployed to Myc target genes, as recently proposed in 3T3 fibroblasts. Analogous scarcities in transcriptional machinery could also explain why some tissues fail to respond transcriptionally to Myc. We observed that both total and phosphorylated levels of Rpb1 are significantly lower in the adult heart in comparison to the liver (Supplemental Fig.\u00a06b). However, we presume that the levels of Rpb1 are sufficient to allow the transcription of genes required to maintain heart function. Indeed, when we performed RNA PolII ChIP sequencing in the adult heart, we detected heart-specific genes loaded with significant amounts of RNA PolII. There are several potential mechanisms that may concentrate the available RNA PolII at specific locations. First, it is possible that the generation of \u201ctranscriptional hotspots\u201d might concentrate essential factors at the relevant genes. Second, transcription in the presence of low Rpb1 may be aided by tissue-specific super enhancers that recruits a large portion of the enhancer-associated RNA PolII and its associated cofactors and chromatin regulators, unfortunately, testing of these hypotheses lies outside the scope of this manuscript. Myc has been shown to modify both RNA PolII loading and its phosphorylation by P-TEFb (refs. ). We showed that responsiveness of individual tissues to Myc correlates with the levels of expression of the basal transcription factors, P-TEFb and RNA PolII, the pause factors, DSIF and NELF, and, inversely, with the expression of the P-TEFb repression complex.", "Adult mammalian heart is a prototypical, terminally differentiated, Myc non-responsive tissue in which Cyclin T1 is known to be a limiting transcriptional regulator, and whose chronic ectopic overexpression elicits promiscuous RNA polymerase activity and cardiac hypertrophy. While P1 neonatal heart retains proliferative potential, this rapidly declines after birth and is largely lost by P7 (refs. ). This decline in neonatal cardiac proliferative potential correlates with down-regulation of multiple genes involved in cell cycle, including endogenous Myc, which is high at P1 but significantly reduced by P5 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a). Although changes in microRNAs (refs. ), modulation of the Hippo pathway, and wholesale metabolic switching from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation have all been implicated, the mechanism underlying post-natal cardiac maturation and loss of regenerative potential remains unknown. Interestingly, both neonatal mouse heart and the zebrafish larval heart express high levels of P-TEFb. However, whereas the zebrafish adult heart retains 70% of its larval levels of P-TEFb and remains competent to regenerate throughout development, P-TEFb levels in the non-regenerative adult mouse heart drop by 85% (refs. ). Little is known regarding the regulation of P-TEFb during mammalian cardiac development. Levels of Cyclin T1 are regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, with mitogens and cytokine signalling known to increase Cyclin T1 protein stability. We and others have shown that the level of Cyclin T1 is the key factor regulating the level and activity of P-TEFb within cardiomyocytes. Oncogenic Ras signalling increases Cyclin T1 in the heart, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. It is tempting to speculate that the noted oncogenic cooperation between Ras and Myc may, in part, arise through Ras-dependent induction of P-TEFb, so promoting the efficiency of Myc-driven transcription.", "Re-establishing regenerative proliferation in the adult heart has proven very difficult. Inhibition of Hippo signalling, enforced expression of both G1 (CDK4 and Ccnd1) and G2/M (CDK1 and Ccnb1) factors, and hypoxia all elicit modest regeneration, but at levels well below those of P1 neonatal heart. While the adult heart is refractory to Myc-induced proliferation, enforced ectopic Myc expression during neonatal life did extend the window of neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation up to around P15, a period that that coincides with high endogenous cardiac P-TEFb expression. The large increase in cardiomyocyte number and aurora B localisation to centrally located mid-bodies suggests that cardiomyocytes isolated from juvenile mice can progress through the cell cycle and many can complete cytokinesis. Remarkably, we show that an increase in the level of P-TEFb in the adult heart is sufficient to support ectopic Myc-dependent transcription, proliferation and cytokinesis of cardiomyocytes in vivo, resulting in increased heart size and cardiomyocyte number within a very short timeframe. Importantly, this transient wave of proliferation induced in a smaller fraction of total cardiomyocytes than in juvenile mice is compatible with long-term survival. It will be of great interest to determine if this genetic combination will prove beneficial in models of cardiac injury.", "Despite the significant changes in regenerative capacity and responsiveness to Myc that attend cardiac development from embryonic stem cells through mesoderm to precursor cardiomyocyte to cardiomyocyte, the chromatin status at promoters for genes involved in basic cellular function, including cell cycle regulation, show very little variation. Similarly, the Myc binding sites of the adult liver (proliferative) and the adult heart (non-proliferative) exhibit significant overlap, indicating that even after its maturation, adult, terminally differentiated heart retains an open chromatin architecture at sites required to drive transcriptional control of proliferation. Hence, if Myc could be induced by mitogenic stimulus in the heart, cardiac epigenome architecture does not preclude heart regenerative capacity: rather, it is the inability of Myc to drive transcriptional output from regenerative target genes (due to lack of the P-TEFb) that thwarts cardiomyocyte proliferation.", "Overall, our data indicate that tissue regenerative capacity is tightly linked to the capacity of that tissue to respond to Myc and that tissue Myc responsiveness is governed principally by availability of key components of the core transcriptional machinery, which Myc co-opts to drive its regenerative biological output. However, in addition to its core target genes, which are common across tissues, a significant number of its targets are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. By contrast, tissue-specific accessibility of target genes to Myc appears to be dictated principally by hard-wired, tissue-specific epigenome organisation. Our current study focuses in the main on liver and heart as, respectively, prototypical examples of regenerative and Myc-responsive vs non-regenerative and Myc-unresponsive tissues.
