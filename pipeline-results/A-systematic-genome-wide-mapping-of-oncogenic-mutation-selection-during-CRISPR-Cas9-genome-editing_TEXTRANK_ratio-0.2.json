This could lead to a selection of cells with pre-existing p53 mutations. In this study, employing an integrated computational and experimental framework, we systematically investigated the possibility of selection of additional cancer driver mutations during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. We first confirm the previous findings of the selection for pre-existing p53 mutations by CRISPR-Cas9. We next demonstrate that similar to p53, wildtype KRAS may also hamper the growth of Cas9-edited cells, potentially conferring a selective advantage to pre-existing KRAS-mutant cells. These selective effects are widespread, extending across cell-types and methods of CRISPR-Cas9 delivery and the strength of selection depends on the sgRNA sequence and the gene being edited. The selection for pre-existing p53 or KRAS mutations may confound CRISPR-Cas9 screens in cancer cells and more importantly, calls for monitoring patients undergoing CRISPR-Cas9-based editing for clinical therapeutics for pre-existing p53 and KRAS mutations."], "Introduction": ["Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) enables targeted gene disruption and editing, a powerful technology that expands our understanding of fundamental biological processes. Beyond its impact on biological research, CRISPR-based approaches have been considered for various applications in medicine, from reparative editing of primary cells to the development of new strategies to treat a variety of genetic diseases, including cancer. However, several clinical trials based on CRISPR technology have been deferred due to significant potential risks, including off-target effects, generation of unexpected chromosomal alterations, and potential immunogenicity. Other studies have demonstrated that double-stranded breaks (DSBs) induced during CRISPR-Cas9-based gene knockout (CRISPR-KO) can lead to DNA damage response, whose level can either be associated with the copy number of the targeted gene or in some cases structural rearrangements in the region.", "Recent studies have shown that the DNA damage response following CRISPR-KO can be mediated by p53, a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in over 50% of all human cancers. Genome-wide CRISPR screening in immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells revealed that a p53-mediated DNA damage response, followed by cell cycle arrest, is induced upon generation of DSBs by the Cas9 endonuclease, favoring the survival of cells that have inactivated the p53 pathway. Most recently, a study showed that exogenous expression of Cas9 can also activate this p53-mediated DNA damage response. While these studies indicate that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques may select for p53-mutated cells, several outstanding questions remain unaddressed: First, since most of these p53 studies have involved only a small number of primary or transformed cells, it is unclear whether p53 selection can happen broadly across multiple different cell types including transformed cancer cells. Second, it is not clear whether stronger p53 selection can happen when certain genes or parts of the genome are targeted, or the level of selection is more homogenous regardless of the genes being edited. And finally, it remains to be investigated whether this selection is limited to p53 only or that other cancer driver genes can also be selected for during CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.", "To address these questions, here we employ a computational framework coupled with experimental validations to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each cancer driver mutation-selection associated with CRISPR-Cas9. We first demonstrate that CRISPR-KO-induced mutant p53 selection can be observed in transformed and non-transformed cells of diverse lineages via both lentivirus and ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based Cas9 delivery. More importantly, we systematically characterized mutation-selection in other cancer driver genes during CRISPR-Cas9 identifying that KRAS mutants can also be selected for, as demonstrated in large-scale genetic screens and Cas9-expressing cell lines. We further identified the underlying pathways that are likely to mediate this selection."], "Methods": {"CRISPR and shRNA essentiality screen data": ["We obtained CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen (or dependency profile) data in 436 cell lines from Meyers et al. for 16,368 genes, whose expression, CNV, and mutation data are available via\u00a0the CCLE portal. We obtained the shRNA essentiality screen data in 501 cell lines from the\u00a0DepMap portal for 16,165 genes, whose expression, CNV, and mutation data are available publicly via\u00a0the CCLE portal. The 248 cell lines and 14,718 genes that appear in both datasets were used in this analysis (Supplementary Data\u00a01). For mutation data, only non-synonymous mutations were considered. Synonymous (silent) mutations were removed from the pre-processed MAF files downloaded from the CCLE portal."], "Identifying CRISPR specific differentially essential genes of a potential CRISPR-selected cancer driver": ["For a given CCD (e.g. p53 or KRAS), we checked which gene\u2019s essentiality (viability after knockout) is significantly associated with the mutational status of the CCD using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in the CRISPR and shRNA datasets, respectively (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1). CRISPR-specific differentially essential positive (CDE+) genes are those whose CRISPR-KO is significantly more viable when the CCD is mutated while their shRNA silencing is not, whereas analogously CDE\u2212 genes are those whose CRISPR-KO is significantly more viable when the CCD is WT while their shRNA silencing is not. We filtered out any candidate CDE genes whose copy number was also significantly associated with the given mutation to control for potentially spurious associations coming from copy number (we removed genes showing significant association (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1))\u2014the exact procedure used is described below in the section titled \u201cIdentifying potential CRISPR-selected cancer drivers\u201d)."], "Identifying CDEs considering the functional impact of mutations": ["Out of a total of 248 cell lines that we analyzed, 173 cell lines (69.7%) have p53 non-synonymous mutations. In addition to identifying CDEs by considering all non-synonymous mutations, we additionally employed a more conservative approach where we aimed to consider only p53 LOF mutations in the CDE identification process. To this end, we considered a mutation to be LOF if it was classified as non-sense, indel, frameshift, or among the 4 most frequent non-functional hotspot mutations (R248Q, R273H, R248W and R175H within the DNA-binding domain, determined as pathogenic by COSMIC). Using this definition we obtained new mutation profiles for p53 and identified CDE genes via the same method described in the section titled \u201cIdentifying CRISPR specific differentially essential genes of a potential CRISPR-selected cancer driver\u201d. We repeated a similar process with the top three known gain-of-function hotspot mutation variants of KRAS."], "Identifying potential CRISPR-selected cancer drivers of CRISPR-KO": ["To identify additional CCD genes like p53, we considered 121 cancer driver genes identified by Vogelstein et al., whose nonsynonymous mutation is observed in at least 10 cell lines (N\u2009=\u200961). We determined whether each of these genes is a CCD as follows: for each of the 61 candidate genes, we tested the association between the essentiality of each of genes in the genome (reflected by post-KO cell viability) with the mutational status of the candidate CCD gene using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We then counted the number of genes, whose essentiality is: (i) significantly positively associated with the candidate CCD mutational status (FDR-corrected P-value\u2009<\u20090.1, median essentiality of WT\u2009>\u2009mutant of the cancer gene), (ii) significantly negatively associated with the candidate CCD mutational status (FDR-corrected P-value\u2009<\u20090.1, median essentiality of WT\u2009<\u2009mutant of the cancer gene), and (iii) not associated (FDR-corrected P-value\u2009>\u20090.1) with the candidate CCD mutation status; we performed this computation separately for the CRISPR and the shRNA screens, respectively. This computation results in a 3-by-2 contingency table for each candidate CCD gene. We then checked whether the distribution of the above three counts in the CRISPR dataset significantly deviates from that in the shRNA dataset via a Fisher\u2019s exact test on the contingency table. If each of the values in the contingency table was >30, we used the chi-squared approximation of Fisher\u2019s exact test. We further filtered out any candidate CDE genes whose copy number was also significantly associated with the given mutation to control for potentially spurious associations coming from copy number (we removed genes showing significant association (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1)). We performed this procedure for all 61 candidate genes one by one and selected those with FDR corrected Fisher\u2019s exact test\u2009<\u20090.1. We further filtered out the candidate CCD whose mutation profile is correlated with p53 mutation profile via a pairwise Fisher test of independence (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1). We finally report the CCD genes that have a substantial number of CDE+ genes (N\u2009>\u2009300)."], "Pathway enrichment analysis of CDE+/CDE\u2212 genes": ["We analyzed the CDE+/CDE\u2212 genes of each of the CCDs for their pathway enrichment with annotations from the Reactome database in two different ways. First, we tested for significant overlap between our CDE genes with each of the pathways with hypergeometric tests (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1). Second, we ranked all the genes in the CRISPR-KO screen by the differences in their median post-KO cell viability values in mutant vs. WT cells, and the standard GSEA method was employed to test whether the genes of each Reactome pathway have significantly higher or lower ranks vs. the rest of the genes (FDR\u2009<\u20090.1). We repeated the GSEA analysis with the genes ranked by differential post-KD cell viability in the shRNA screen and only reported significant pathways specific to CRISPR but not shRNA screens. We confirmed that for p53, the GSEA method was able to recover the top significant pathways identified by the hypergeometric test (e.g. those in Fig.\u00a01d), although extra significant pathways were identified (Supplementary Data\u00a02). For p53 and KRAS CDE\u2212 genes respectively, the enriched pathways were clustered based on the Jaccard index and the number of overlapping genes with Enrichment Map, and the largest clusters were visualized as network diagrams with Cytoscape.", "To study the potential enrichment of CDE genes in CFSs, we obtained chromosomal band locations of CFS and defined the CFS gene set as the set of all genes located within these chromosomal bands (obtained from Biomart). We tested for significant overlap between our CDE genes and the CFS gene set with a hypergeometric test, and also confirmed the lack of significant overlap with the corresponding shRNA-DE genesets. Similarly, for the common HAC regions, we obtained a list of these regions defined by a consensus of DNAsel and FAIRE across seven different cancer cell lines from a previous study. Next, we identified sgRNAs that are expected to target such HAC regions (see the \u201cCalculating off-target scores\u201d section) and ranked genes based on the number of targeting such sgRNAs. Taking the top genes equal to the number of p53 CDE+ genes, we computed the enrichment for p53 CDE+ genes via a hypergeometric test."], "Testing the clinical relevance of copy number alterations of the p53 or KRAS CDE genes": ["We tested the hypothesis that copy number alterations in CDE+ genes (as a possible surrogate for the number of DSBs in these genes) can reduce the fitness of the CCD (p53 or KRAS) WT tumors with patient data. The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data of somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) and patient survival of 7547 samples in 26 tumor types were downloaded from the UCSC Xena browser (https://xenabrowser.net/). In these tumor types, p53 is mutated in more than 5% of the samples. For each sample, the copy number alterations (GI) of a given set of genes, which quantifies the relative amplification or deletion of genes in a tumor based on SCNA was computed as follows:", "where si is the absolute log ratio of SCNA of gene i in a sample relative to normal control, and I() is the indicator function. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was then used to test whether the GI of CDE+ geneset is significantly lower than that of control non-CDE genes in CCD-WT but not in CCD-mutant tumors. Further, we tested if higher absolute levels of SCNA of the CDE+ genes are associated with increased rate of CCD (p53 or KRAS) mutation accumulation with cancer stage, as this would further testify that such amplification/deletion events in the CDE+ genes can drive the selection for CCD mutants. To this end, the following logistic regression model was used to identify the genes whose high absolute SCNA computed as above is associated with a higher rate of CCD mutation accumulation with cancer stage, while controlling for cancer type and overall mutation load:", "where CCD denotes the binary CCD mutational status of the patient, logit(P(CCD)) is the logit function of the probability of the CCD being mutant; cancer_typek is the dummy variable for the category of the kth cancer type; GIi denotes the absolute value of SCNA levels of the given gene i as computed above; GIi * stage is the interaction term between the GI of gene i and cancer stage, that latter is made into a binary variable whose value is 0 for early stages (I and II) and 1 for late stages (III and IV). We tested the enrichment of CDE+ genes among the genes whose high absolute SCNA levels are significantly associated with a higher rate of CCD mutation accumulation with cancer stage (i.e. genes with significantly positive \u03b2interact coefficients in the above model) using a hypergeometric test."], "Constructs and stable cell lines": ["MOLM13 cells were obtained from DSMZ (Cat.

Secondly, we wanted to understand what type of sgRNAs, genes, and gene networks drive this selection. We analyzed the\u00a0DepMap genome-wide gene essentiality data across 248 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Data\u00a01), where both CRISPR-Cas9 (AVANA) and shRNA-based (Achilles) genetic screens were conducted. We searched for genes whose CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout (CRISPR-KO) reduced cell viability more (i.e. more essential) in p53-wildtype (WT; N\u2009=\u200975) than p53-mutant (N\u2009=\u2009173) cell lines, but do not exhibit such differential essentiality in the shRNA-based screens (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). The KO of such genes may select for p53 mutants specifically during CRISPR-Cas9 editing. In the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we find many more genes (981) that are more essential in p53-WT vs. p53-mutant cell lines, compared to the genes that are more essential in p53-mutant cells (237 genes). In contrast, the numbers of such differentially essential genes in the shRNA screens were balanced (~1500 each). Such significantly different patterns between CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA screens (Fig.\u00a01a left panel, Chi-squared test P\u2009<\u20091.4E\u2212284) points to a bias that knockout/knockdown of a gene is more likely to impair the fitness of p53-WT cells specifically with CRISPR-Cas9 but not with shRNA.", "Among the 981 genes that are more essential in p53-WT cells with CRISPR-KO, 861 genes (87%) do not exhibit this differential essentiality in shRNA screens. We hence termed these CRISPR-specific differentially essential positive (CDE+) genes (Fig.\u00a01a right panel; genes listed in Supplementary Data\u00a02A). We find that these CDE+ genes are preferentially located in chromosomal bands containing common fragile sites (CFSs; hypergeometric P\u2009<\u20092.3E\u22124, Fig.\u00a01b, Supplementary Data\u00a03), which are prone to replicative stress, fork collapse and DNA breaks that cause genomic instability (GI). As CRISPR-KO could induce kilobase-scale structural alterations near the targeted site, this finding suggests that CRISPR-targeting near CFSs may enhance DNA damage, promote the p53-dependent cell death response and provide a selective advantage to p53-mutant cells. The sgRNAs of the CDE+ genes also tend to target highly accessible chromatin (HAC) (hypergeometric P\u2009<\u20090.02; see the \u201cMethods\u201d section), thus inducing a strong damage response. The top pathways enriched within CDE+ genes include DNA damage response, DNA repair, and Fanconi anemia (FA; hypergeometric test adjusted P\u2009<\u20090.01, Supplementary Data\u00a02B). This is consistent with the recent report that the FA pathway is involved in repairing Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and that their KO may further enhance DNA damage.", "Analogous to CDE+, we defined CDE\u2212 genes, which are more essential in p53-mutant (vs. WT) cells with CRISPR-KO, but do not show\u00a0such difference in shRNA screens (185 genes, right panel of Fig.\u00a01a). CDE\u2212 genes are involved in cellular processes that engage p53, including mitotic checkpoints, DNA replication and cell cycle (Supplementary Data\u00a02B, Fig.\u00a01d, hypergeometric test adjusted P\u2009<\u20090.1), with the top hit being the key cell cycle regulator CDKN1A (a.k.a. p21, Wilcoxon rank-sum P\u2009<\u20091.85E\u221208, Fig.\u00a01c). Transiently inhibiting CDE\u2212 genes during CRISPR-KO may mitigate p53 mutation selection and could be of interest from a translational point of view. Top CDE+/\u2212 genes are highlighted in Fig.\u00a01c.", "We next tested for a series of confounding factors that can potentially lead to this skewness (expanded details in Supplementary Notes\u00a01, 2, 6). We repeated our analysis in the following modes to control for: 1. Gene copy number variations in cell lines, by correcting for gene copy number via a linear regression while testing whether a gene is differentially essential in WT vs. mutant cell lines (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01), 2. Functional effect of different p53 variants, by focusing on cell lines harboring known loss-of-function (LOF) p53 mutations solely (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section, N\u2009=\u200978) vs. WT (Supplementary Note\u00a01a), 3. Effect of partial vs. complete silencing of gene expression in case shRNA-KD and CRISPR-Cas9 KO, respectively, by using genes that are not expressed at all (Supplementary Note\u00a01b), 4. Effect of a potential functional relationship, e.g. synthetic lethal or rescue interaction with p53, by using non-essential genes (Supplementary Note\u00a01c), 5. Effect of different reagents and sgRNA depletion time, by using independent CRISPR-Cas9 screen (Sanger Screen) performed using 326 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Note\u00a02, Supplementary Fig.\u00a02), 6. Off target effect of sgRNA, by computing and taking into account an off-target score of the sgRNA used in the screens (Supplementary Note\u00a06). We showed that our findings via the CDE identification process remain valid after controlling for this broad array of potentially confounding factors.", "We next performed our own CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen, employing CRISPRi-based essentiality screens as a control in a pair of p53-isogenic MOLM13 leukemia cell lines (WT and p53 R248Q mutant). We used a deep (10 guides per gene) and focused sgRNA library targeting top p53 CDE+ and CDE\u2212 genes (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section; Fig.\u00a02a, details in Supplementary Note\u00a010, Supplementary Data\u00a04). Here, we observed in the CRISPR-Cas9 screen that the CDE+ genes are more essential in p53-WT vs. mutant cells, and vice versa for the CDE\u2212 genes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P\u2009<\u20090.08 and P\u2009=\u20090.03 for CDE+/\u2212 genes respectively). Reassuringly, we do not see such differential essentiality in the CRISPRi screens (Wilcoxon signed-rank P\u2009=\u20090.32 and 0.29; Top 10% CDE+/\u2212 genes are depicted in Fig.\u00a02b).", "To further assess whether such selection effects can be observed in non-transformed cells, we next tested and observed that indeed our p53 CDE+ genes have higher essentiality in WT vs. isogenic-mutant cells in published CRISPR-Cas9 but not shRNA genome-wide screens performed in non-transformed RPE1 cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03, screens quality control discussed in Supplementary Note\u00a09 and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04). This finding is further confirmed by mining seven CRISPR-KO genome-wide screens, including two p53-null and five p53-WT RPE1 cells screens (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05, Supplementary Note\u00a03)."], "A competition assay shows selection for p53 mutant over wildtype cells following CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of CDE+ genes": ["To test whether the CRISPR-KO of CDE+ genes leads to the selection of p53-mutant cells in a competitive setting, we silenced the top five predicted CDE+ genes using CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPRi in the p53-isogenic MOLM13 cells (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). Following a lentiviral sgRNA transduction, the WT and mutant cells were mixed at an initial ratio of 95:5, and monitored by flow cytometry for up to 25 days (illustrated in Fig.\u00a03a; Supplementary Data\u00a05A). Silencing 2/5 CDE+ genes (NDUFB6 and NDUFB10) induced a strong progressive p53 mutant enrichment of up to five folds over WT at day 25 specifically in CRISPR-KO, across several independent sgRNAs and not for NTC (Fig.\u00a03b, blue lines). No inverse enrichment in p53 WT cells was observed in the competitive assays involving the three other CDE+ genes (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06). We observed that sgRNAs targeting NDUFB6 induced significantly higher DNA damage compared to NTC-treated cells specifically in p53 WT cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a07, despite higher editing\u00a0efficiency\u00a0in the mutant cells as shown in Fig.\u00a04c), demonstrating that the DNA damage was not just due to Cas9 expression. This may partly explain their selective competitive advantage upon the CDE+ gene KO. Testing the robustness of this competitive selection advantage for p53-mutant cells, we repeated the CRISPR-KO competitive assay for a larger number of 18 top CDE+ genes with up to four unique sgRNAs per gene and monitored the assay up to 15 days (Supplementary Data\u00a05B). Using the non-targeting sgRNA as a baseline, we observed the competitive outgrowth of p53-mutant cells for 15 out of 28 sgRNAs and 10 out of 18 CDE+ genes tested (Fig.\u00a03c)."], "p53 mutation-selection phenomena extend to transient knockout and primary cells": ["We next asked whether our top CDE+ genes may also select for p53 mutants under CRISPR-Cas9 transient knockout. We delivered Cas9 and the sgRNA as an RNP. We observed that upon Cas9-RNP mediated transfection of a sgRNA targeting our top CDE+ gene from our pooled and competition assays, NDUFB6 (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section), there was a higher loss of edited cells in the p53 WT vs isogenic p53-mutant MOLM13 cells over 10 days of culture, as measured by the change in ICE scores (Fig.\u00a04a top panel). Using an orthogonal method of proliferation monitoring by dye-dilution, we observed that there was a progressive slowing down in cell proliferation of p53 WT, but not p53 mutant MOLM13 cells upon Cas9-RNP based KO of NDUFB6 vs. respective non-targeting controls (NTCs) (Fig.\u00a04b, c). Similar to the lentiviral system, this is likely due to the DNA damage induced by the NDUFB6 sgRNA compared to the Cas9 only or Cas9 with NTC controls in p53 WT cells (Figs.\u00a04b and S8). We repeated this transient knockout in non-transformed cells (RPE1) and consistently observed an increased loss of edited p53 WT over p53-mutant cells (Fig.\u00a04a, bottom panel). Notably, we also observed a selection of p53 mutant over WT in patient tumors profiles (TCGA) based on the copy number alteration patterns of CDE+ genes (details in Supplementary Note\u00a011A)."], "KRAS mutant cell lines exhibit a selection advantage in large-scale genetic screens": ["To determine whether additional cancer driver mutations may be selected for the following CRISPR-KO, we focused on a list of 61 cancer driver genes from Vogelstein et al. that are mutated in at least 10 of the cell lines screened in the AVANA and Achilles datasets. For each of these cancer genes, we identified the differentially essential genes between its WT and mutant cell lines in the CRISPR-Cas9 (AVANA) and shRNA (Achilles) screens, as described above for p53. We ranked the cancer genes by the significance of skewness in the numbers of differentially essential genes from CRISPR-Cas9 vs. shRNA screens similar to that shown in Fig.\u00a01a for p53 (with Fisher\u2019s exact tests, see the \u201cMethods\u201d section; results shown in Fig.\u00a05a and Supplementary Data\u00a06). The mutants of these genes may be selected for during CRISPR-KO, as their WT cells are overall more vulnerable during CRISPR-KO compared to the mutants. We term these genes \u201c(potential) CRISPR-selected cancer drivers\u201d (CCDs). The top significant CCD in addition to p53 is the oncogene KRAS. Like for p53, potential confounding factors including copy number were controlled for (Supplementary Note\u00a01, Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b), and there is no significant correlation between the mutation profiles of KRAS and p53 (Fisher\u2019s test P\u2009=\u20090.67), suggesting that KRAS might be a CCD independent of p53. We thus next focused on investigating the selection of mutant KRAS as another major CCD.", "KRAS is a major oncogene whose gain of function mutation is known to activate various DNA repair pathways and may override the trigger of cell death upon DNA damage, supporting its role as a CCD. We computationally identified the CDE+ and CDE\u2212 genes of KRAS in a similar way described above for p53 (Fig.\u00a05b, Supplementary Data\u00a02A). KRAS has high numbers of CDE+/\u2212 genes, while only very few KRAS mutation-associated genes are identified in the shRNA screen. The predicted median mutant selection levels are comparable to those of p53 (Supplementary Note\u00a04), i.e. the CRISPR-KO of its CDE+ genes is likely to drive comparable levels of mutant selection as the KO of the CDE+ genes of p53. Fourteen genes are CDE+ genes of both p53 and KRAS, and thus their CRISPR-KO may impose considerable selection for both KRAS and p53 mutants (Supplementary Data\u00a02A). Consistent with the knowledge of downstream pathways regulated by activated KRAS, its CDE\u2212 genes are significantly enriched for DNA DSB repair pathways (FDR\u2009<\u20090.02, see the \u201cMethods\u201d section, visualized in Fig.\u00a05c, Supplementary Data\u00a02E).", "Based on the number of CDE+ genes (Fig.\u00a05a), the third-ranked CCD is VHL, having a large number of CDE+ genes. Like p53 and KRAS, we controlled for a series of potential confounding factors (Supplementary Notes\u00a01, 2, 6). We also note that the CDE+ genes of VHL were also enriched in chromosomal bands of CFSs (hypergeometric P\u2009<\u20092.4e\u22122). The known function of VHL as a positive regulator of p53 in DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis possibly accounts for its role as a CCD. However, in this study, we chose to carefully study one additional CCD and our top-ranked hit\u2014KRAS and its potential mutant selection during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and thus will focus on that from here onwards."], "Pooled essentiality screens show that KRAS CDE+ genes are more essential in WT than mutants and vice versa for CDE\u2212 genes specifically in CRISPR-Cas9 screens": ["Similar to p53, we next performed our own CRISPR-Cas9 and a control CRISPRi gene essentiality screens, but on a smaller scale, in a pair of isogenic KRAS WT and KRAS G12D mutant MOLM13 cell lines using a sgRNA library targeting top KRAS CDE+ and CDE\u2212 genes (details in Supplementary Note\u00a010, Supplementary Data\u00a07). Here, we observed that the KRAS CDE+ genes are more essential in WT than mutants and vice versa for CDE\u2212 genes specifically in CRISPR-Cas9 screens (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P\u2009<\u20090.074 and P\u2009<\u20090.042 for CDE+/\u2212, respectively, Fig.\u00a06a left panel), but not in CRISPRi screens (Wilcoxon signed-rank P\u2009<\u20090.22 and P\u2009<\u20090.49; Fig.\u00a06a right panel). Similar results were obtained from analyzing published genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA genetic screens performed in a different pair of KRAS isogenic cell lines (WT and G12D mutation in DLD1 cell line; Fig.\u00a06b). Similar to p53, we also observed a selection of KRAS mutants in patient tumor profiles (TCGA) based on the copy number alteration patterns of its CDE+ genes (details in Supplementary Note\u00a011B)."], "A competition assay shows selection for KRAS mutant over wildtype cells following CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of KRAS CDE+ genes": ["To test whether, like the p53 case, CRISPR-KO of KRAS CDE+ genes can confer a selective advantage to KRAS mutant over WT cells in co-culture, we conducted a similar competition assay using a pair of WT and KRAS G12D mutant isogenic MOLM13 cell lines. As in the experiment for p53, we mixed the WT and KRAS mutant cells at an initial ratio of 95:5 following KRAS CDE+ sgRNA transduction and monitored the population for 15 days to track the percentage of KRAS-mutant cells (TdTomato+) with flow cytometry (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section; Supplementary Data\u00a08). A total of 10 KRAS CDE+ genes were tested, in addition to NTC. In the control group, the KRAS mutant cell fraction decreased with time, indicating that the mutant cells have lower baseline fitness levels than the WT cells. In comparison, in 8 out of 10 CDE+ genes tested, there is a gain in the fitness of the mutant cells (Fig.\u00a06c; see the \u201cMethods\u201d section), testifying that even though the KRAS-mutant cells have a lower baseline fitness level, the CRISPR-KO of the majority of CDE+ genes can enhance their fitness and in a subset of cases lead to selective outgrowth of KRAS mutant over WT cells in a mixed population."], "Cas9 expression in cancer cell lines selects for KRAS mutations": ["Multiple studies have reported a higher editing efficiency of Cas9 in p53 mutated versus p53 WT cell lines. We first asked if this may also extend to KRAS as an equally important CCD. Analyzing induced exogenous Cas9 activity in 1601 cancer cell lines from DepMap (1375 and 226 KRAS WT and mutant, respectively), we find that, like p53, Cas9 activity is significantly higher in KRAS-mutant cells than in KRAS WT cells (P\u2009=\u20092.9E\u221205, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Fig.\u00a06d; see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). We repeated the above analysis modeling Cas9 activity vs. KRAS status adjusting for p53 status in a linear model, yielding concordant findings (P\u2009=\u20092.43E\u221204, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test). Importantly, across all the 61 cancer driver genes we analyzed above from Vogelstein et al., KRAS and p53 are the only ones showing such a significant difference in Cas9 activity between WT and mutant cells after FDR correction (FDR\u2009=\u20099.1E\u221204 for KRAS and 7.1E\u221206 for p53, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, Fig.\u00a06e). This further shows that in addition to p53, KRAS WT status can also hamper the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9.", "Based on the above findings and a recent report of selection for p53 mutant due to DNA damage upon Cas9 expression (without sgRNA), we asked whether DNA damage induced by Cas9 alone can also lead to a mutation-selection of KRAS and/or other cancer drivers. To this end, we re-analyzed deep sequencing profiles from 42 Cas9-expressed vs. matched parental (i.e. without Cas9) cell lines (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section) from Enache et al., and identified a total of 9 cases involving 5 unique KRAS mutations, occurring in 7 different cell lines with moderate to high Cas9 activity (Methods). Seven out of these 9 cases show increased mutant allele frequency after induced Cas9 expression (Wilcoxon signed-rank test P\u2009=\u20090.027, Fig.\u00a06f). Four of the 5 KRAS mutations are missense mutations; the other mutation is an intronic mutation occurring 100\u2009bp from the splicing site. This mutation is not present in the parental cell lines but emerges independently after Cas9 expression in four different cell lines. While the results suggest that CRISPR-Cas9 may select for KRAS mutations, the functional role of these mutations needs to be interpreted with caution. Among the 61 cancer driver genes from Vogelstein et al., KRAS is a top gene (ranked the second) along with p53 (ranked fourth) that shows significant mutant sub-clonal expansion (Fig.\u00a06g). Notably, the top genes identified to be involved in mutant sub-clonal expansions have a significant overlap with our previously identified top CCD genes (Fisher\u2019s exact test P\u2009=\u20090.04). We note that when we repeated the above analysis excluding the intronic deletion, KRAS is ranked 16th out of 61 genes tested (Wilcoxon rank-sum P\u2009<\u20090.28)."]}, "Discussion": ["In this study, we systematically investigated the possibility of selection of pre-existing cancer driver mutations during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. First, we confirmed and extended upon previous findings that selection of pre-existing p53 mutations by CRISPR-Cas9 can happen, showing it in a large set of transformed and non-transformed cell lines. We identified the specific CDE+ genes whose CRISPR-KO is likely to mediate such selection, and further tested and validated some of these predictions in new screens and competitive assays that we have performed. After studying and validating our integrated computational and experimental pipeline in the known case of p53, we turned to applying it to study a collection of major cancer driver genes and discovered that KRAS is another major cancer driver gene whose pre-existing mutants have a selective advantage during CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. We demonstrated the selective advantage of KRAS mutant cells performing a CRISPR-KO/CRISPRi screen in isogenic cells with pooled CDE+ gene-targeting sgRNAs, and further in competition assays during the CRISPR-KO of top predicted KRAS CDE+ genes. We also observed that KRAS WT cells have lower Cas9 activity and thus a lower editing efficiency, similar to that observed for p53, which may limit CRISPR-mediated gene-editing in such cells. Analyzing recently published KRAS screens, we also find a subclonal expansion of KRAS mutant cancer cells following Cas9 expression. Finally, our study also shows that the introduction of the Cas9 protein downregulates the G2M checkpoint and E2F targets in KRAS mutant, but not KRAS WT cells, which may confer a selective advantage to KRAS-mutant cells.", "Multiple factors can contribute to the identity of CDE+ genes, including involvement in DNA repair and cell cycle pathways, being located in chromosomal fragile sites or HAC regions, supporting that their CRISPR-KO can lead to augmented DNA damage. We find that these factors can together account for up to 15% of our CDE+ genes. We also observed that a gene-targeted by highly off-target guides can also lead to high DNA damage, which reassuringly only accounts for up to 10% of the CDE+ genes (details in Supplementary Note\u00a06). Taken together, these three putative mechanisms can explain about 25% of the CDE+ genes we have identified, however, the mechanisms underlying the rest are yet open to further studies.", "Overall, our results point to a need for accounting for CDE effects in the analysis of dependencies in CRISPR screens. More importantly, our studies point to the need for careful selection of sgRNAs for therapeutic genome editing and recommend cautionary monitoring of KRAS status in addition to that of p53 during therapies utilizing CRISPR-Cas9. Lastly, in the publicly available CRISPR-Cas9 screens that we have analyzed, the current small numbers of cell lines with mutations in other cancer drivers, such as VHL, limits our ability to reliably determine whether these cancer genes could also be selected during CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. The investigation of the latter thus awaits specifically designed screens in designated isogenic cell lines."]}, "config": {"method": "TEXTRANK", "config_kwargs": {"ratio": 0.2}}, "summary": {"Abstract": [], "Introduction": ["While these studies indicate that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques may select for p53-mutated cells, several outstanding questions remain unaddressed: First, since most of these p53 studies have involved only a small number of primary or transformed cells, it is unclear whether p53 selection can happen broadly across multiple different cell types including transformed cancer cells.\nAnd finally, it remains to be investigated whether this selection is limited to p53 only or that other cancer driver genes can also be selected for during CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing."], "Methods": {}, "Results": {"CRISPR-Cas9 gene-knockouts selects for p53 mutations in a vast variety of transformed and non-transformed cell types": ["We analyzed the\u00a0DepMap genome-wide gene essentiality data across 248 cancer cell lines (Supplementary Data\u00a01), where both CRISPR-Cas9 (AVANA) and shRNA-based (Achilles) genetic screens were conducted.\nWe searched for genes whose CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout (CRISPR-KO) reduced cell viability more (i.e. more essential) in p53-wildtype (WT;
