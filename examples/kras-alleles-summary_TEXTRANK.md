# The origins and genetic interactions of KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific

summarization method: TEXTRANK

## Introduction

Importantly, the activating alleles found in KRAS vary substantially across cancers, indicating possible differences in signaling behavior of the mutant proteins that exploit the environment of the specific cellular context.
Likely as a consequence of their distinct properties, associations have been uncovered between the specific KRAS mutation status and therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes of cancer patients.

## Results

### KRAS alleles are non-uniformly distributed across cancers

Across all the alleles, KRAS was most frequently mutated in PAAD (86%), followed by COAD (41%), LUAD (35%), and MM (22%; Fig. 1a).

### The KRAS alleles have different mutagenic origins

Within each cancer type, the relative abundance of the mutational signatures was generally consistent across tumor samples, regardless of the KRAS allele (Fig. 1c).
To discern if specific mutagenic processes were more likely to have caused particular KRAS alleles, the trinucleotide context of the KRAS mutation and the relative activity of the mutational signature in that tumor were used to calculate the probability that the allele in an individual tumor was caused by any detectable mutational process (Fig. 1d).

### The frequency of most KRAS alleles cannot be solely attributed to the prevalence of detected mutagens

The null hypothesis tested was that, assuming the cancer would acquire a KRAS mutation and one of the common alleles (found in >3% of the tumor samples for a given cancer) was sufficient, the frequency of the KRAS alleles would be determined by the mutational processes alone.
The increased probability of a KRAS G12C mutation in tumor samples that did obtain the allele compared to KRAS WT LUAD tumor samples is likely due to the strong association between this mutation and signature SBS4 induced by carcinogens in tobacco smoke.

### The KRAS alleles have distinct comutation networks

The result of the comutation analysis on COAD tumors was a weakly connected network of the KRAS alleles with only a few genes linking the alleles together (Fig. 3a).
Contrary to a common assumption, while KRAS and TP53 were frequently found mutated in the same tumor, there was a detectable reduction in comutation between TP53 with KRAS G12D and G13D compared to the rest of the alleles (Fig. 3b).
As in the network derived from COAD, many of these genes were involved in integral KRAS signaling pathways, including an increased comutation interaction between KRAS G12A and MAP2K3, a reduced comutation interaction between KRAS G12D and ERBB4, and a very strong increased rate of comutation between KRAS G12C and STK11 (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
The KRAS allele comutation network found in the PAAD tumor samples demonstrated that many genes had detectable comutation interactions with multiple alleles, primarily of reduced comutation (Supplementary Fig. 7a).
There were many notable cellular functions and processes enriched in the comutation networks of the KRAS alleles (Fig. 3c), including the protein–protein interaction networks (PPIN) of SMAD1-3 and TGF-\(\beta\) signaling.

### KRAS allele-specific genetic dependencies reveal potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities

To discover individual genes with allele-specific interactions, each gene was tested for differential genetic dependency with the cell lines grouped by their KRAS allele.
In these cell lines, 130 individual genes demonstrated KRAS allele-specific genetic dependency (Supplementary Fig. 10a and Supplementary Data 11).

## Discussion

However, allele-specific genetic interactions were not consistent between tissues, demonstrating the complex relationship between the tissue-of-origin, KRAS function, and cooperating genetic events.
The principle of this phenomenon was demonstrated by the analysis of the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, when the comutation events were included as explanatory covariates: in several instances, the allele-specific dependency originally assigned to a specific KRAS mutation could instead be attributed to an allele-specific co-mutant gene.
