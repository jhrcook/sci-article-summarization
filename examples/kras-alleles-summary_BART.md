# The origins and genetic interactions of KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific

summarization method: BART

## Introduction

Located at a critical signaling junction between extracellular growth receptors and pro-growth pathways, KRAS is one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer. It is frequently mutated in only a handful of cancers, with the highest frequencies in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Activating KRAS mutations result in elevated engagement of downstream pathways.

## Results

This study utilized publicly available sequencing data from COAD, LUAD, MM, and PAAD. KRAS was most frequently mutated in PAAD (86%), followed by COAD (41%), LUAD (35%), and MM (22%; Fig. 1a). At the allele level, most mutations by single-nucleotide substitutions occurred at one of four “hotspot” codons: 12, 13, 61, and 146.
The trinucleotide context of the KRAS mutation and the relative activity of the mutational signature in that tumor were used to calculate the probability that the allele in an individual tumor was caused by any detectable mutational process. In many cases, specific mutational signatures were much more likely to have caused the observed mutation than expected based on their background frequencies.
All of the KRAS alleles were observed at a significantly different frequency than predicted by mutational signatures. In PAAD, the G12R mutation is expected to occur in 5.2% of PAAD tumors, which is far below the actual frequency of 16.7%. In COAD, G13D was predicted to be the most frequent allele (27%) but was observed less frequently (20%). The frequencies of G12S and A146T mutations were also overestimated, whereas G12D/V mutations were considerably underestimated. The Pearson correlations between the observed and predicted KRAS allele frequencies for each cancer ranged from 0.4 to 0.6.
Comutation analysis on COAD tumors revealed a weakly connected network of KRAS alleles with only a few genes linking the alleles together. KRAS and TP53 were frequently found mutated in the same tumor, but there was a detectable reduction in comutation between TP53 with KRAS G12D and G13D. Consistent with the idea that each allele is functionally distinct, a substantial number of genes comutated with one KRAS allele.
KRAS G12V had an increased rate of comutation with TCF7L2, which encodes TCF4, a regulator of Wnt signaling often dysregulated in COAD. Several of the alleles showed enrichment for cellular functions in their comutation networks. The KRAS allele-specific comutation network uncovered in LUAD was far larger than that of COAD (Supplementary Fig. 5a)
There were many notable cellular functions and processes enriched in the comutation networks of the KRAS alleles. These subtle differences suggest that specific and nuanced alterations of SMAD signaling best complement a given KRAS allele in PAAD. The perturbations necessary to drive cancer expose vulnerabilities that are not present in the normal cell-of-origin.
KRAS alleles with a sufficient number of cell lines were G12D, G12R, and G12V. GSEA revealed substantial differences in the dependencies of critical cellular pathways. In these cell lines, 130 individual genes demonstrated KRAS allele-specific genetic dependency.

## Discussion

Study addresses the genetic complexity of cancer through a genetic interaction analysis of oncogenic KRAS alleles in COAD, LUAD, MM, and PAAD. Measuring the levels of mutational signatures revealed that the cancer-specific distributions of KRAS mutations were influenced, but not determined, by the active mutational processes in the tumor samples.
This study has broad implications for the understanding of oncogene biology and for cancer therapy. Whether a targeted therapy directly inhibits the activated oncoprotein or not, it is important to understand
