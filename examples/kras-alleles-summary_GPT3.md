# The origins and genetic interactions of KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific

summarization method: GPT3

## Introduction

The KRAS gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer. However, it is frequently mutated in only a handful of cancers, with the highest frequencies in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), multiple myeloma (MM), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Importantly, the activating alleles found in KRAS vary substantially across cancers, indicating possible differences in signaling behavior of the mutant proteins that exploit the environment of the specific cellular context. When mutated at one of its four hotspot codons—12, 13, 61, or 146—activated KRAS protein hyperactivates many downstream effector pathways, such as the MAP

## Results

### KRAS alleles are non-uniformly distributed across cancers

KRAS is the most common oncogene in human cancers. This study utilized publicly available sequencing data from four types of cancers (colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma) to characterize the mutations in KRAS. The most common mutation was G12C, which accounted for more than three-quarters of all mutations. However, there was substantial variability of

### The KRAS alleles have different mutagenic origins

The authors of this article wanted to find out why there is a difference in KRAS allele frequencies in different cancers. They found that the KRAS alleles are not determined by the mutational signatures, but rather, the mutational signatures are determined by the KRAS alleles.

### The frequency of most KRAS alleles cannot be solely attributed to the prevalence of detected mutagens

The extent to which mutational signatures represent the mechanism driving KRAS allelic diversity was further analyzed by calculating the predicted frequency of each allele based on the frequency of mutations in the same trinucleotide context throughout the exome or genome (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 6). The null hypothesis tested was that, assuming the cancer would acquire a KRAS mutation and one of the common alleles (found in >3% of the tumor samples for a given cancer) was sufficient, the frequency of the KRAS alleles would be determined by the mutational processes alone. The average predicted frequencies across the samples of each cancer were compared against the observed allele frequencies (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 6). The authors used a large dataset of cancer samples to examine the distribution of KRAS alleles in various cancers. They found that the frequency of KRAS mutations in cancer was not random, but that certain KRAS mutations were more likely to be found in certain cancers. They then used a mathematical model to determine what factors influenced the distribution of KRAS mutations. They found that the mutational processes in a tissue did not determine which KRAS mutation was gained,

### The KRAS alleles have distinct comutation networks

The KRAS gene is mutated in a large number of cancers, and the mutations are often mutually exclusive, meaning that a tumor will have either a KRAS mutation or a mutation in another gene, but not both. The authors of this paper wanted to find out why this is the case. They hypothesized that if the mutations are driven by natural selection, then the mutations would have to have different effects on the cell. They tested this hypothesis by looking at the mutations in different cancers and seeing if they were more likely to be found together than expected by chance. They found that the mutations were more likely to be found together when they had different effects on the cell. This suggests that the mutations are being selected for because they are beneficial to the cell.

The authors also looked at the genes that were linked to KRAS by these mutations. They found that many of the genes were well known cancer genes, such as BRAF and The KRAS gene is mutated in a majority of human cancers, including colon, lung, pancreatic, and melanoma. It is also mutated in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). The KRAS gene encodes a GTPase protein that is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. The KRAS G12D mutation is present in approximately 30% of all human cancers and is the most frequently mutated gene in lung cancer. The G12D mutation is also present in a subset of NSCLC. The G12D mutation is associated with poor clinical outcomes in lung cancer and NSCLC. This study examines the role of the KRAS G12D mutation in NSCLC. The study shows that the G12D mutation is present in a subset of NSCLC and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The study also shows that the G12D mutation is associated with a distinct molecular

### KRAS allele-specific genetic dependencies reveal potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities

The KRAS oncogene is mutated in a large proportion of human cancers. In this study, we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen of cancer cell lines to identify genes with KRAS allele-specific genetic dependencies. The analysis was restricted to KRAS alleles for which there were at least three different cell lines with the mutation, limiting the following investigation to only COAD and PAAD cell lines. Allele-specific enrichments for signaling pathways and cellular processes were identified using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and individual genes demonstrating differential genetic dependency by KRAS allele were identified using ANOVA (p value  The KRAS G12D, G12R, and G12V alleles were associated with different dependencies on specific cellular processes, signaling pathways, and individual genes.



## Discussion

The KRAS gene is a proto-oncogene that is mutated in a large proportion of human cancers. Although the molecular mechanisms by which KRAS mutations promote tumorigenesis are well-studied, the genetic interactions that arise during cancer progression are not well understood. To address this question, we analyzed the genetic interactions of KRAS alleles in four different tumor types. We found that the genetic interactions of KRAS alleles were tissue-specific, and that the biological properties of the KRAS alleles, within the context of the tissue-of-origin, is an important factor in the positive selection of a KRAS mutation during the evolution of a tumor.

 The oncogene BRAF is mutated in about half of melanomas and colorectal cancers, and in a subset of lung cancers. The mutation activates a signaling pathway that promotes cancer cell growth
