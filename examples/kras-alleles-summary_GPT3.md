# The origins and genetic interactions of KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific

summarization method: GPT3

## Introduction

The KRAS gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer. However, it is frequently mutated in only a handful of cancers, with the highest frequencies in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), multiple myeloma (MM), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Importantly, the activating alleles found in KRAS vary substantially across cancers, indicating possible differences in signaling behavior of the mutant proteins that exploit the environment of the specific cellular context. When mutated at one of its four hotspot codons—12, 13, 61, or 146—activated KRAS protein hyperactivates many downstream effector pathways, such as the MAP

## Results

The authors of this study used publicly available sequencing data from four different cancers (COAD, LUAD, MM, and PAAD) to determine the frequency of KRAS mutations at different codons. They found that the most common mutations were at codon 12, followed by codon 13, 61, and 146. The authors also found that there was substantial variability of the alleles found at these hotspots across the four KRAS-driven cancers. For example, MM was the only cancer where a non-G12 allele, Q61H, was the most frequent. At codon 12, LUAD had an enrichment for G12C mutations. COAD had a unique enrichment of G13D and A146T alleles, while PAAD was distinct in its high frequency of G12R mutations. One potential explanation for the distinct allelic frequencies across cancer types is that tissue-specific mut
The KRAS G12C mutation is a common event in MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP), a rare autosomal recessive disease form of colorectal cancer (CRC) caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations to the gene encoding the DNA glycosylase, MUTYH, responsible for clearing 8-oxoguanine:A mismatches that can cause the G12C mutation. In MAP, the KRAS G12C mutation is primarily attributable to mutations caused by tobacco smoke. In contrast, KRAS G12D mutations are most likely attributable to clock-like mutations.
The mutational signatures of KRAS in human cancers were predicted using a machine-learning approach. The predictions were validated by comparing the observed and predicted frequencies of KRAS alleles in a large set of human cancers. The results suggest that the mutational signatures of KRAS are not solely determined by the prevalence of their respective causative single-nucleotide substitutions.
The results of this study indicate that the distribution of KRAS alleles in cancer is not random, but rather is influenced by the biological properties of the alleles themselves and the signaling context of the tissue. This study also provides a framework for understanding how KRAS mutations are selected in cancer.
The KRAS gene is a key oncogene in many cancers, including colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). The KRAS G12D mutation is the most common mutation in these cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. Here, we report that KRAS G12D has a reduced comutation interaction with TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, in COAD. This reduced comutation interaction was also observed in LUAD, but not PAAD. We also found that KRAS G12D has an increased comutation interaction with MAP2K4, a known oncogene. These results suggest that KRAS G12D may have different molecular consequences in different cancers, and that the molecular
The KRAS gene encodes a GTPase protein that is a key regulator of the RAS signaling pathway. The KRAS G12D mutation is the most common mutation in human cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis in many cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic effects of the KRAS G12D mutation are not well understood. Here, we show that the KRAS G12D mutation induces a distinct cellular phenotype in cancer cells, including increased proliferation, migration, and invasion. We also show that the KRAS G12D mutation induces a distinct genetic interaction profile in cancer cells, including increased genetic interactions with genes involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. These results suggest that the KRAS G12D mutation induces a distinct cellular phenotype and genetic interaction profile in cancer cells, which may contribute to the oncogenic effects of the KRAS G12D mutation.

The KRAS G12D allele was associated with a reduced dependency on the genes at the G2 and M DNA damage checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Moreover, the G12R cell lines were less dependent on PI3K signaling downstream of FGFR1, driven through a reduced dependency on FRS2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2) and GRB2, which encodes a protein linking EGFR to the GEF SOS1 (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Similarly, the cell lines with KRAS G12V mutations were less sensitive to the knockout of genes implicated in cellular senescence (Supplementary Fig. 9d). This enrichment was driven by a significantly reduced dependence upon JUN, which encodes the transcription factor c-JUN, and a

## Discussion

This study addresses the genetic complexity of cancer through a comprehensive genetic interaction analysis of oncogenic KRAS alleles in COAD, LUAD, MM, and PAAD. Measuring the levels of mutational signatures revealed that the cancer-specific distributions of KRAS mutations were influenced, but not determined, by the active mutational processes in the tumor samples. This result suggests that the biological properties of the KRAS alleles, within the context of the tissue-of-origin, is an important factor in the positive selection of a KRAS mutation during the evolution of a tumor. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that mutant forms of KRAS produce distinct molecular and cellular phenotypes that are largely dependent upon the tissue context,,. To investigate allele-specific genetic properties, we conducted statistical tests to identify patterns of comutating genes and genetic dependencies
The oncogene BRAF is mutated in a large fraction of melanomas and other cancers. The most common mutation is a substitution of the amino acid valine for the amino acid glutamine at position
